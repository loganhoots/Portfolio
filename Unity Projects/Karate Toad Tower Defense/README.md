# Karate Toad Tower Defense #

Karate Toad Tower Defense is a tower defense/hack and slash style videogame. In this game, you play as a frog who attacks spiders as they attack to enter you castle and kill off your siblings.

Karate Toad Tower Defense is a game developed for the Grand Canyon University course Game Design and Game Play Lecture and Lab in collaboration by four developers: Logan Hoots, Tyler Williams, Tristan Janisse, and Chi Cao. Throughout this course we completed many steps in the videogame development process including spending nine weeks making a Game Design Document, spending two weeks creating a board game adaptation of the video game, and lastly spending four weeks developing the digital version of the game in Unity.
