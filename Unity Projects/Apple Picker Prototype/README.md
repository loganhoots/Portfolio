# Unity Projects - Apple Picker Prototype #

These Unity Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Human-Computer Interaction and Communication Lecture and Lab, AI in Games and Simulations Lecture and Lab, and Game Design and Game Play Lecture and Lab in collaboration by many developers including: Logan Hoots, Paul Andrews, Brett Silvey, Jonathon Lopez, Tyler Williams, Tristen Janisse, and Chi Cao. To create each game, we used the tools Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, and Unity Hub/Unity Editor. Each game is unique to a specific project from within one of the courses and they do not necessarily relate to eachother.

Apple Picker Prototype is a Unity Game made to be a warm up to using Unity. In this game, apples drop randomly from an apple tree. It is the players goal to catch as many apples as they can before they lose all their lives. The player can move their baskets by dragging their mouse.
