# Unity Projects - Space SHMUP Prototype #

These Unity Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Human-Computer Interaction and Communication Lecture and Lab, AI in Games and Simulations Lecture and Lab, and Game Design and Game Play Lecture and Lab in collaboration by many developers including: Logan Hoots, Paul Andrews, Brett Silvey, Jonathon Lopez, Tyler Williams, Tristen Janisse, and Chi Cao. To create each game, we used the tools Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, and Unity Hub/Unity Editor. Each game is unique to a specific project from within one of the courses and they do not necessarily relate to eachother.

Space SHMUP Prototype is a Unity Game made to test out different window perspectives. In this game, the player controls a space ship and shoots at UFO's. If the UFO's come into contact with the player, the player's shield gets damaged and they become closer to losing.
