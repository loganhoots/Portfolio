# Unity Projects - Boat Project #

These Unity Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Human-Computer Interaction and Communication Lecture and Lab, AI in Games and Simulations Lecture and Lab, and Game Design and Game Play Lecture and Lab in collaboration by many developers including: Logan Hoots, Paul Andrews, Brett Silvey, Jonathon Lopez, Tyler Williams, Tristen Janisse, and Chi Cao. To create each game, we used the tools Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, and Unity Hub/Unity Editor. Each game is unique to a specific project from within one of the courses and they do not necessarily relate to eachother.

Boat Project is my first Unity Game. The purpose of this game was to familiarize myself with Unity and learn it as a game development platform. In this game, the player is on board a pirate ship and can man cannons. Using the cannons the player can shoot boxes to earn points.
