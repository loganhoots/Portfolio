# Unity Projects - Mission Demolition Prototype #

These Unity Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Human-Computer Interaction and Communication Lecture and Lab, AI in Games and Simulations Lecture and Lab, and Game Design and Game Play Lecture and Lab in collaboration by many developers including: Logan Hoots, Paul Andrews, Brett Silvey, Jonathon Lopez, Tyler Williams, Tristen Janisse, and Chi Cao. To create each game, we used the tools Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, and Unity Hub/Unity Editor. Each game is unique to a specific project from within one of the courses and they do not necessarily relate to eachother.

Mission Demolition Prototype is a Unity Game made to demonstrate more mechanics that are possible from using Unity. In this game, the player will launch marbles at a various structures with the goal of having the marble reach the green section of the structures. When a marble reaches the green section the level is completed and then a new level will start.
