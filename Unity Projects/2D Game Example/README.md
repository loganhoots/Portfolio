# Unity Projects - 2D Game Example #

These Unity Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Human-Computer Interaction and Communication Lecture and Lab, AI in Games and Simulations Lecture and Lab, and Game Design and Game Play Lecture and Lab in collaboration by many developers including: Logan Hoots, Paul Andrews, Brett Silvey, Jonathon Lopez, Tyler Williams, Tristen Janisse, and Chi Cao. To create each game, we used the tools Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, and Unity Hub/Unity Editor. Each game is unique to a specific project from within one of the courses and they do not necessarily relate to eachother.

2D Game Example is a Unity Game made to test out various lighting within Unity. This involved creating a new pipeline in Unity and a mock game. The player is able to move the character left and right using A and D respectively and additionally can shoot fireballs by pressing E.
