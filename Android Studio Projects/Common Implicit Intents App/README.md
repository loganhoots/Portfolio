# Android Studio - Common Implicit Intent App #

These Android Studio Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Mobile Game Development Leacture and Lab by Logan Hoots. To create each app, I used the tool Android Studio. Each app is unique to a specific project from within the course and does not necessarily relate to another app.

The Common Implicit Intent App is an Android App that allows users to email, call, text, search the internet, and search locations.
