# Android Studio Projects #

These Android Studio Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Mobile Game Development Leacture and Lab by Logan Hoots. To create each app, I used the tool Android Studio. Each app is unique to a specific project from within the course and does not necessarily relate to another app.

Because these files were made for Grand Canyon University, these files can only be used by possible future employers of Logan Hoots.
