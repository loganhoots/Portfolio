# Android Studio - President List App #

These Android Studio Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Mobile Game Development Leacture and Lab by Logan Hoots. To create each app, I used the tool Android Studio. Each app is unique to a specific project from within the course and does not necessarily relate to another app.

The President List App is an Android App that stores a list of US presidents.
