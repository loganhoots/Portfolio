# Android Studio - Weather App #

These Android Studio Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Mobile Game Development Leacture and Lab by Logan Hoots. To create each app, I used the tool Android Studio. Each app is unique to a specific project from within the course and does not necessarily relate to another app.

The Weather App is an Android App that allows the user to enter a location and then uses a Rest API to determine the weather for that area.
