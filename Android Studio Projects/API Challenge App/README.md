# Android Studio - API Challenge App #

These Android Studio Projects were programmed for the Grand Canyon University course Mobile Game Development Leacture and Lab by Logan Hoots. To create each app, I used the tool Android Studio. Each app is unique to a specific project from within the course and does not necessarily relate to another app.

The API Challenge App is an Android App that allows users to lookup Pokemon based on a Pokemon Rest API.
