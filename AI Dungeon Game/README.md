AI Dungeon Game is a dungeon explorer videogame. In this game, you play as an archer where your goal is collect 10 coins before the Goblin catches you as while an eyeball and mushroom monster get in your way. Upon collecting 10 coins, you unlock the skeleton boss fight who you must defeat to win.

AI Dungeon Game is a game developed for the Grand Canyon University course AI in Games and Simulations Lecture and Lab. Throughout this course I implemented many forms of AI into this game including A* Path Finding, Adaptive Dynamic Programming, Bayes Nets, Kalman Filters, Least Contrasting Value Heuristics, Minimax Theory, Policy Iteration, and Markov Decision Processing.
