# Custom C-- Compiler #

Custom C-- Compiler is a coded compiler using languages C, Bison, and Flex. It is capable executing programs written in a custom programming language called C--.

Custom C-- Compiler is a compiler written for the Grand Canyon University course Principles of Compiler Design Lecture and Lab in collaboration by three developers: Logan Hoots, Paul Andrews, and Brett Silvey. Throughout this course we programmed a Lexical Analyzer, a Syntactic Analyzer, a Semantic Analyzer, and an Assembly Language Code generator. 

The most important aspects of a compiler are the abstract syntax tree, symbol table, and Assembly MIPS code generation. Below is more information about how we programmed each of these.
